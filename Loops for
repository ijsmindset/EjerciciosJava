/*
this is la sintaxis y structure of the loop 'for'
first writing in lower case 'for' after open the () inside of this starting variable 'int i = ;'
 (this part the name is i* for clean code 'i' of the initiation only used for starting program).
next i <= 10; (here we writing variable i more the condition example is i* more big than 10? )
if i* is less than 10 the loop keep run.
next this loop starting in 1 and finish in 10 to make it stop we can make each turn add one for
 example with this intruction i++ or subtrac one i-- or what add two in two i = 2.
when this is complete print out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and we can make to see well  concatenamos i + ", "
the exit there see:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ....
