# Java Practice Exercises to Learn and Improve

This repository contains a collection of practical **Java exercises** created with the goal of **learning**, **practicing**, and **improving** my skills as a developer.
## Purpose
- Strengthen core Java knowledge.
- Develop programming logic through varied exercises.
- Build a reference base for future improvements.
- Learn to write better code and clearer technical documentation.

## What You'll Find Here
- Exercises covering basic syntax, control structures, classes, and objects.
- Practice focused on improving code readability and organization.
- Comments and documentation that will evolve over time.

## In Progress
This repository is a work in progress. My goals include:
- Refactoring code as I learn best practices.
- Improving documentation to make it clearer and more useful.
- Adding new exercises as I continue learning.

## Motivation
Learning to code well isn't just about writing code that worksâ€”it's about understanding it, explaining it, and improving it. This project is my space to grow as a developer and document that journey.

### Note
If you find any mistakes, have suggestions, or ideas to improve the exercises, theyâ€™re more than welcome!
Thanks for visiting this repository. Step by step, we improve! ðŸ’ª
